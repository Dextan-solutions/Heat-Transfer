# Heat-Transfer
This code compute the heat transfer along a 1 meter metal bar over 3 seconds. It was also checked over 9 seconds
It is based on the use of Tridiagonal matrix to solve differential equation of conduction in solid.

The temperature of a metal bar (1meter long) is raised to 200o𝐶 and the bar is then quickly transferred into a 
chamber to prevent heat loss from the surfaces of the bar except the ends which are in contact with coolant at 
0o𝐶. 
Compute the distribution of temperature on the bar over 3𝑠 using implicit discretization.
