# Heat-Transfer
This code compute the Temprature distribution along a 1 meter metal bar over 3 seconds using implicit discritization of parabolic linear partial differential equation. It was also checked over 9 seconds.
It is based on the use of Tridiagonal matrix to solve the discritized parabolic linear partial differential equation of conduction in solid.

The temperature of a metal bar (1meter long) is raised to 200o𝐶 and the bar is then quickly transferred into a 
chamber to prevent heat loss from the surfaces of the bar except the ends which are in contact with coolant at 
0o𝐶.
